	We request you retain the full copyright notice below including the link to www.phpbb.com.
	This not only gives respect to the large amount of time given freely by the developers
	but also helps build interest, traffic and use of phpBB3. If you (honestly) cannot retain
	the full copyright we ask you at least leave in place the "Powered by phpBB" line, with
	"phpBB" linked to www.phpbb.com. If you refuse to include even this then support on our
	forums may be affected.

	- You cannot remove my copyright notice from style without my permission.
	- You cannot use images from this style anywhere else without my permission.
	- You cannot convert this style to another software without my permission.
	- If you want to create new phpBB style based on this style you must ask my permission (unless its for your own use only).
